## Software Internationalization

Software internationalization has two facets:

-   **World-readiness:** This covers the generic coding and design issues and comprises two major areas: **Globalization** is the process to develop a program core whose features and code design are not solely based on a single language or locale. **Localizability** is the process to enable a program to be localized into different languages without any changes to the source code.
-   **Localization:** This involves translating and customizing a product for a specific market.

With the growing software demands all over the world, it would be a good idea to plan supporting to design and implement the software to support various languages and data formats.

### [Internationalization for Windows Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318661(vs.85).aspx)

The development of world-ready applications requires the use of many services and tools. Windows contains features that enable you to develop solutions that will support the different language-specific and locale-specific needs of users around the world (including specialized text enablement, sorting behavior, date and time formatting, and keyboard layouts).

### [National Language Support](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd317708(vs.85).aspx)

The National Language Support (NLS) functions permit applications to:

-   Set the locale for the user
-   Identify the language in which the user works
-   Retrieve strings representing times, dates, and other information formatted correctly for the specified language and locale
