## Quality Assurance for World-Readiness

The goal of ensuring world-readiness has a wider scope and requires more fore-thought than merely testing localized applications. It must start early on by determining the necessary criteria for globalization and hence world-readiness.

## The World-Ready Approach to Testing

Single code-base design, unified data-processing algorithms, and elimination of functionality problems due to localization are some of the benefits of software globalization. These benefits will reduce redundancy in test runs on localized products and make simultaneous release possible.

## Globalization of the Test

The first step to test the world-readiness of a product is to verify that its functionality is globalized. Rather than testing for globalization of every single system component of multiple products, by globalizing the test you check for world-readiness at the same time you check the general functionality of a core product's entire system.

## Localizability Testing

The purpose of localizability testing is to verify that the UI of the program being tested can be easily translated to any target language without re-engineering or making code modifications. Since localizability bugs have to be fixed in the code of the application, they must be looked for at the earliest stage of development possible.

## Localization Testing

Localization testing checks how well the build has been translated into a particular target language. This test is based on the results of globalized testing where the functional support for that particular locale has already been verified.

## The Role of Test Tools

Using automated test tools is an effective way to verify the functionality of localized products or to test a product's globalization. Automation makes it easier to deal with the highÂ volume of test cases and allows you to efficiently track the results of the globalized test. Restoring the locale settings or test input that brought about a failure in a program also becomes easier.

## Sample International Test Cases

The sample test items are broken up into basic areas of functionality and are accompanied by details on how these areas can be verified, what the potential problems associated with certain areas are, and when the test is applicable.
